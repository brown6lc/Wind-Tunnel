Wind Tunnel Senior Design Project
Mechanical Construction & Design Team
8-Foot Wind Tunnel System
Overview

This project was completed as part of the Senior Design course in the Applied Physics/Engineering
program. Our team was responsible for the mechanical construction and design of an 8-foot wind
tunnel intended for educational laboratory use and preliminary aerodynamic testing.
The objective was to design a structurally sound, modular, safe, and easily serviceable wind tunnel
capable of producing uniform, measurable airflow for experiments involving drag, lift, flow visualization,
and sensor calibration.

Project Goals
- Design and construct the mechanical body of an 8-ft wind tunnel.
- Ensure smooth airflow through proper test section geometry, contraction ratios, and diffuser design.
- Integrate mechanical systems with electrical components (fan, control system) designed by partner
teams.
- Prioritize safety, material accessibility, and long-term durability for repeated academic use.
  
Mechanical Design Responsibilities
Our group focused on all mechanical aspects, including:
1. Frame and Structural Design
- Designed a modular frame supporting the 8-ft tunnel body.
- Selected materials to balance rigidity, vibration damping, cost, and manufacturability.
- Considered thermal expansion, load distribution, and long-term fatigue.
2. Tunnel Body Construction
- Designed the test section, contraction cone, diffuser, and flow conditioning region.
- Chose materials such as acrylic, plywood, and aluminum depending on section requirements.
- Ensured proper alignment and sealing of all sections to minimize turbulence and leakage.
3. Flow Conditioning Components
- Implemented a honeycomb flow straightener and optional screen meshes.
- Designed mounting methods for consistent alignment and easy replacement.
4. Fan and Motor Integration
- Created mechanical interfaces for the fan housing, vibration isolation, and airflow coupling.
- Ensured safe clearances, mounting stability, and service access for the electrical/control team.
5. Assembly & Fabrication
- Oversaw machine shop workflows and fabrication scheduling.
- Constructed, assembled, and tested mechanical subsystems.
- Made iterative adjustments based on airflow tests and structural feedback.
  
Key Design Features
- 8-foot total length for stable airflow development.
- Transparent test section for visualization and measurement.
- Removable panels for maintenance and access.
- Vibration-isolated fan mount to reduce noise and flow disturbances.
- Modular section design enabling upgrades or experimental modifications.
  
Testing & Validation
The following tests were conducted during development:
- Smoke and fog flow visualization to assess turbulence.
- Static pressure measurements along the tunnel body.
- Velocity measurements in the test section using an anemometer/hot-wire probe.
- Mechanical vibration and leak testing.
- Fit-up checks of all joints and seals.
Findings from testing guided several refinements, such as improving sealing surfaces, reinforcing frame
attachment points, and adjusting the diffuser angle.

Team Contributions (Mechanical Subgroup)
- CAD modeling of all mechanical components (Fusion 360).
- Material selection and sourcing.
- Precision fabrication and machining.
- Mechanical assembly and troubleshooting.
- Documentation of assembly procedures and mechanical performance.
